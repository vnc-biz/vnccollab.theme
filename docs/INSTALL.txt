vnccollab.theme Installation
----------------------------

The preferred way to install vnccolla.theme is using zc.buildout, mr.developer
and the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to manage your project, you can do
this:

* Add the following to your buildout.cfg file:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        pyzimbra
        collective.notices
        collective.z3cform.datepicker
        collective.braveportletsmanager
        vnccollab.common
        vnccollab.content
        vnccollab.theme

    extensions +=
        mr.developer

    auto-checkout =
        pyzimbra

    [instance]
    ...
    zcml =
        ...
        collective.customizablePersonalizeForm
        collective.customizablePersonalizeForm-overrides

    [sources]
    pyzimbra = git git://github.com/vipod/pyzimbra.git rev=11947681d3beac84bdce8b2dcd7bc432dad5c1dd

    [versions]
    collective.js.jqueryui = 1.8.16.8
    plone.app.jquery = 1.7.2



* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout

You can skip the ZCML slugs if you are going to explicitly include the packages
from another package's configure.zcml file.
